## Part 1: Design Feedback Questions

Walk through the homepage. Key questions:

### Overall Feel
- "Does this feel like **you**? Does it match how you want to be perceived?"
- "Too corporate? Too casual? Just right?"
- "Any competitors or peers whose sites you like/dislike?"

### Hero Section
- Dark navy background with photo on right—"First impression?"
- "Speaker. Consultant. Strategist." tagline—accurate?
- "Where AI Policy Meets Real-World Impact"—headline resonate?

### Color & Typography
- Navy blue (#0F172A) + sky blue accent (#0EA5E9)—work for you?
- Lora (serif headings) + Nunito (body)—feel warm/authoritative enough?

### Layout
- Services order: Speaking → Consulting. Correct priority?
- Testimonial section placement—important to you?
- Dark "bookend" sections (hero + CTA)—feels cohesive?

## Part 2: Content Audit — Placeholder / Fabricated Content

### 🟠 STATISTICS — Need Verification

**Speaking Page:**
| Stat | Current Value | Question |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Keynotes Delivered | 50+ | Accurate? |
| Countries | 15+ | Accurate? |
| Audience Members | 10K+ | Accurate? |

**CTA Section (Homepage):**
| Stat | Current Value | Question |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Organizations Advised | 50+ | Accurate? |
| Years Experience | 10+ | (Matches "over a decade" in copy ✅) |

---

### 🟡 TESTIMONIAL — Placeholder

**Current testimonial used site-wide:**
> "Sean's guidance was instrumental in shaping our AI governance strategy. His ability to translate complex policy considerations into actionable frameworks helped us move confidently into AI adoption while maintaining stakeholder trust."
> — **J. Smith**, Technology Executive, Enterprise Client

**Question:** "Do you have a real testimonial we can use with permission? Name, title, company? If not, we can remove testimonial sections entirely."

---

### 🟡 COPY VERIFICATION

**Credibility Line:**
- Site: "First Global Head of AI Policy at Uber"
- Copy.md: "First Global Head of AI & Fairness Policy at Uber"
- **Difference:** "& Fairness" is missing. Which is accurate?

---

### ✅ 7 CORE OFFERINGS — Implemented

The Consulting page includes all 7 service areas from your copy. Minor title variations:

| Copy.md | Site | Match |
|---------|------|-------|
| Building AI Governance | Building AI Governance | ✅ |
| Strategy & Risk Assessment | Strategy & Risk Assessment | ✅ |
| Policy Translation & Regulatory Intelligence | Policy Translation | ⚠️ Shortened |
| Ethics Frameworks That Scale | Ethics Frameworks That Scale | ✅ |
| Executive Education & Workshops | Executive Education & Workshops | ✅ |
| Civil Rights & Impact Assessments | Civil Rights & Impact Assessments | ✅ |
| Presentations & Keynotes | Expert Briefings | ⚠️ Different title |

**Question:** "Are the shortened/changed titles acceptable, or do you prefer the exact wording from your original copy?"

---

### ✅ NEWSLETTER PAGE — Already Built

"The Human Cost" newsletter page exists at `/newsletter` with:
- Title and tagline from copy ✅
- Subscribe CTA (placeholder button—needs link to actual newsletter platform)
- "What to Expect" section with themes

**Question:** "Where should the Subscribe button link? Substack? Beehiiv? Something else?"

---

### 🟡 SPEAKING PAGE — Topic Descriptions

The **topic titles** are reasonable, but **descriptions are generic**:

| Topic | Current Description | From Copy? |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| AI Governance & Ethics | "Frameworks for responsible AI deployment..." | Generic |
| Global AI Policy | "Navigating the evolving international regulatory landscape..." | Generic |
| Leadership in the AI Era | "Preparing executive teams to make confident decisions..." | Generic |
| The Future of Work | "How AI will reshape industries..." | Generic |

**Options:** 1) Provide real descriptions, 2) Keep generic, 3) Remove descriptions entirely and just show titles

---

### 🟡 CASE STUDY — One Detail to Verify

**AI Action Summit case study on Speaking page:**
- Event name: AI Action Summit, Paris ✅ (from copy)
- Description: Accurate ✅
- Client/Organizer: **"Global Policy Forum"** — **Is this the actual organizer name?**

---

## Part 2B: Minor Copy Deviations (Not Significant — FYI Only)

These are small wording differences between copy.md and the site. Not worth discussing in the meeting unless client is detail-oriented. Just note where the content lives if changes are needed later.

### About Page Intro Tagline
- **File:** `app/about/page.tsx:71-72`
- **Site:** "Bridging the gap between technological innovation and responsible governance to help organizations harness AI's potential."
- **Copy:** No equivalent — this is fabricated filler
- **Action:** Keep as-is or ask for real tagline

### Congressional Detail (Minor Omission)
- **File:** `app/about/page.tsx:126-130`
- **Site:** "As Counsel to the late Congressman Elijah Cummings"
- **Copy:** "As Counsel to the late Congressman Elijah Cummings on the House Oversight Committee"
- **Note:** "on the House Oversight Committee" omitted. The career highlight card at line 27-29 includes full detail.

### Speaking Engagements List — Events Added Beyond Copy
- **File:** `components/sections/SpeakingContent.tsx:12-56`
- **Copy lists:** Vanderbilt AI Governance Symposium, Alianza In AI Conference, SXSW, AI Action Summit Paris
- **Site adds:** AI Leadership Summit (Bogota), POLITICO AI Summit, IAPP Privacy Summit, Georgetown AI Forum, CHCI Tech Summit
- **Note:** These appear to be real events from the photos. Copy may just be outdated.

### "Featured At" Venues — Minor Name Differences
- **File:** `components/sections/CredibilityStrip.tsx:6-13`
- **Copy:** "Vanderbilt AI Governance Symposium"
- **Site:** "Vanderbilt AI Symposium"
- **Also added to site:** Georgetown Law, IAPP Privacy Summit

### "What You Get" Descriptions — Condensed
- **File:** `components/sections/ConsultingContent.tsx:250-281`
- Descriptions are slightly condensed from copy (e.g., "designing academic programs from scratch" → "designing academic programs")
- **Note:** No meaning changed, just brevity

### Client Types — Minor Additions
- **File:** `components/sections/ConsultingContent.tsx:21-34`
- **Copy:** "academic institution developing curriculum"
- **Site:** "Academic Institutions - Developing curriculum and research frameworks"
- **Note:** "research frameworks" added

### Newsletter "What to Expect" Themes
- **File:** `app/newsletter/page.tsx:100-126`
- The four theme cards (Policy Analysis, Personal Essays, Critical Questions, Practical Insights) are not in copy.md
- **Note:** These are reasonable fabrications that match the newsletter's described purpose

### Bio Last Line (Intentionally Omitted)
- **File:** N/A (not on site)
- **Copy:** "He's based in the Washington D.C. area. He's an active member of the Northern Virginia commuter."
- **Site:** Location not mentioned
- **Note:** "Northern Virginia commuter" appears incomplete in copy — likely meant something else. Omitted from site.

## Part 3: Missing Assets Checklist

### Photos Needed

| Photo | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|

## Your Talking Points

**Opening:**
"I want to walk you through the site and get your gut reactions on the design direction. Then we'll go through a content checklist—there are some placeholders I need your input on, and some things where I adapted your copy but want to confirm it's accurate."

**On Placeholders:**
"I've clearly marked everything that's a placeholder. For each one, we can either: get the real info from you, write something new together, or delete the element entirely."

**On Stats:**
"These numbers are attention-grabbing but I don't want to publish anything you can't stand behind. Would you rather have accurate lower numbers or no numbers at all?"

**On Testimonial:**
"The testimonial is completely fake right now. If you have a real one with permission, great. If not, we remove it—no fake quotes."

**On Service Titles:**
"I made a couple minor tweaks to your original titles for brevity. Want to confirm those are okay or if you prefer the exact wording."

**Closing:**
"What I need from you after this call: photos, URLs, and decisions on the content gaps. Once I have those, we're very close to launch-ready."

| Item | Status | Notes |

### ⚠️ Things Client Will See (Expected — In Meeting Prep)

These are intentional placeholders already documented above:

| Item | What They'll See | Where |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Testimonial | "J. Smith, Technology Executive, Enterprise Client" | Homepage testimonial section |
| Stats | "50+ Keynotes", "15+ Countries", "10K+ Audience Members" | Speaking page hero |
| Stats | "50+ Organizations Advised" | Homepage CTA section |
| Social links | LinkedIn/X icons link to root domains | Footer |
| Calendly | Button with no link | Contact page |
| Newsletter | Subscribe button disabled | Newsletter page |

### ⚠️ Things to Be Aware Of During Walkthrough

1. **Testimonial is obviously fake** — "J. Smith" / "Enterprise Client" reads as placeholder. Be ready to explain this is intentional and waiting on real testimonial.

2. **Social icons go nowhere useful** — They link to linkedin.com and x.com root, not profile pages. Don't click them during demo.

3. **Calendly button is dead** — Contact page has a "Book a Call" button that does nothing. Mention this is waiting on client's Calendly URL.

4. **Newsletter subscribe is placeholder** — Button exists but doesn't link anywhere yet.

5. **Stats are prominent** — 50+ / 15+ / 10K+ are visible on Speaking page hero. Be prepared for "is that accurate?" question.

### ✅ No Embarrassing Content

- No "lorem ipsum" or "xxx" placeholders in production pages
- No TODO comments visible in rendered HTML
- No broken images
- No console errors
- No visible development warnings

### Mobile Notes

Site is responsive. On mobile walkthrough:
- Hero photo stacks below text (intentional)
- Credential chips hidden on mobile (intentional — they'd be cramped)
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu
- All touch targets appropriately sized
