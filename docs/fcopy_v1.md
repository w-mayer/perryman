### **Positioning Statement**

## **Translating AI Policy Into Business Strategy**

For over a decade, Sean Perryman has worked where technology policy,
corporate strategy, and ethical implementation intersect. He doesn\'t
just analyze what regulations mean---he helps you understand what they
mean for *your* business. How will compliance requirements impact your
product timeline? Where do cost-saving algorithms create legal or
reputational risk? Sean connects policy to the strategic and ethical
questions leaders are actually wrestling with.

From advising Congress on AI accountability to creating Uber\'s first EU
algorithmic transparency report, Sean has an unusual breadth of
knowledge on the AI ecosystem, spanning policy expertise, strategic
foresight, and hands-on implementation experience.

He helps leaders cut through the noise to understand what actually
matters---and how to act on it.

## **Strategic Clarity in a Complex Landscape**

implementation---where ethics, regulation, competitive advantage, and
risk all collide. His approach combines regulatory insight, strategic
thinking, and practical experience to help you make better decisions

startup building responsible systems from the ground up, or an academic
institution developing curriculum, Sean translates complex policy into
actionable strategy.

## **About Sean**

Sean Perryman works at the intersection of AI policy, corporate
strategy, and ethical implementation---helping organizations navigate
one of the most consequential technology transitions of our time.

His career spans Capitol Hill, Silicon Valley, and law school
classrooms. As Counsel to the late Congressman Elijah Cummings on the
House Oversight Committee, Sean advised on the early regulatory debates
that shaped how Congress thinks about facial recognition, algorithmic
accountability, and technology governance. He helped frame questions
that Washington is still trying to answer.

At Uber, as Global Head of AI & Fairness Policy, Sean didn\'t just write
position papers---he built operational systems. He created the
company\'s first EU Algorithmic Transparency Report, a comprehensive
public accounting of how algorithms shape platform decisions. As a core
team member on Uber\'s first Civil Rights Assessment, he helped
translate abstract principles of fairness into concrete practices across
a platform serving millions globally.

In academia, Sean designed Vanderbilt Law School\'s first AI ethics
course, recognizing that lawyers would increasingly need to navigate
technology questions without established legal precedent. He currently
teaches law and policy at both Vanderbilt and Marymount University,
training the next generation to ask better questions about the systems
we\'re building.

Sean currently sits on the Center for Democracy & Technology's Advisory
Board. He previously was appointed by the Federal Communication
Commission's Advisory Committee on Diversity and Digital Empowerment.

What distinguishes Sean\'s work is his ability to move fluidly between
worlds that rarely speak the same language. He translates congressional
intent for engineers, explains technical constraints to policymakers,
and helps executives understand when ethical concerns are actually
business risks in disguise. He\'s equally comfortable briefing C-suite
executives, testifying before lawmakers, or teaching first-year law
students---and he brings the same directness to all three.

Sean doesn\'t offer easy answers to hard questions. Instead, he provides
frameworks for thinking through complexity, anticipating where
regulation is headed, and making decisions that balance innovation with
accountability. His clients describe him as \"refreshingly pragmatic\"
about ethics---someone who understands that perfect solutions rarely
exist, but better decisions always do.

Beyond consulting and teaching, Sean writes and speaks about AI\'s
broader implications through **The Human Cost**, a platform examining
what happens when algorithms increasingly mediate human relationships,
decision-making, and social connection. This work explores the questions
policy discussions often avoid---asking not just whether AI systems are
fair or compliant, but what kind of society we\'re building and whether
it\'s one we actually want.

Sean holds a law degree from Vanderbilt University Law School and spent
years practicing law before entering policy, which gives him unique
insight into the practical day to day implications of his clients and
their business. He\'s based in the Washington D.C. area.

**Speaking Section**

## **Speaking**

Sean Perryman cuts through AI hype and regulatory confusion to deliver
strategic insight leaders can actually use. As a sought-after speaker at
conferences, executive briefings, and academic forums worldwide, he
translates dense policy into strategic insight---helping leaders
understand not just *what\'s coming*, but *what to do about it*.

His talks connect technical developments to business strategy,
regulatory trends to competitive positioning, and ethical questions to
practical decisions.

His talks bridge technical concepts with human impact, regulatory
requirements with business reality, and policy theory with
implementation practice. From keynoting major tech conferences to
leading executive workshops, Sean delivers content that audiences
describe as \"immediately actionable.\"
